how to know which loop to use?
-if we know how many times we wonna iterate throught the loop use for i loop
we can give starting point and ending point
-if we don't know how long it for the loop to go. don't konw how many times
in this case we use while loop, because you will give a condition in the veginning and if that condition is true then it will continue with that loop
when  it's bacomes false  while go through loop and stop

If you know number of iteration use for loop

sum = sum + i; it's the same as  sum += i
 because += means to add i  into sum, make sum = to i + sum

 factorial of the number is that number multiplied to every number before it until it reaches one
 тобто задане число для нас 10 ми множимо кожен раз на нижче наступне число поки не досягнемо 1
 n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1
For example:
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24
0! (by convention) is defined as 1       0=1 !!!! запамятай

ддя факторіал нам треба створити контейнер зверху щоб ми могли додавати  номери
let random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 ) + 1;
let factorial = 1;
console.log(random)
for( let i = 1; i <= random; i++){    /// this i it's our factorial number
factorial *= i     it's gonna take fuctorial, it's going to multiply it by i(whatever is num of random is i)
mens if num is 5,  it's gonna multiply factorial time 1, then times 2 then times 3 rimes 4 5 and stop
}
we can't make factorial 0, because it's stay 0  we need only 1!!!!!!

08 remember if you don't know how namy time you need to run loop, don't use for loop
we need while (when we don't know the exact iteration of the loop)
another question do we nned to use while or do while loop
do while loop -- does task first, and when conditon is met then it will do it again
in our case we do task fist we generate random, and then if it's not % 5
we need creat random num container
let random1;
let attemptsRandom = 0;   / 1 then 2 then count our ettemp
do{
    random1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100 ) + 1;
        attemptsRandom++     ////everytime we enter this loop 
}
while(random1 % 5 !== 0) {       // if while condition it's true then it's will go again run the code, we want to leave the loop when it's divisible by 5
}  /// means if it's not remainder  of 5 then it will go again, if it's %5 it's stop there and exit the loop
